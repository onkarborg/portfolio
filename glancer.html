                        <p>As a team of 3, we decided to explore the possiblities of making job applications simpler
                            and quicker. We realized that the applicant spends too much time putting in the same
                            data on job portals and individual company websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>We walked the data and made several iterations and came up with these ideas which can be
                            used to make these issues diminished. Here are some pictures and outcome of ideation
                            sessions.</p>

                        <p>We finalized 3 Ideas and envisioned a possible implementation for them. We wanted to explore
                            into how our ideas could resolve most of the issues we had enlisted.</p>
                        <p><strong>Efficient and accurate job results and information</strong>: In first vision we made
                            use of QR codes which will store all the information of applicants and recruiters which can
                            be shared and used anywhere just b scanning
                            and storing them through an application. </p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Improved job application process by eliminating repetitive/irrelevant steps</strong>:
                            In second visioning session we came up with idea of creating a whole new application which
                            is made to cater majority of the issues
                            users faced of signing up for different portals, maintain a database for applications where
                            they have applied, deleting jobs which are already expired, etc. </p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Improved data filling process</strong>: The third vision outcome is making a plug-in
                            which can be installed on any browser and which stores all the applicant data and can be
                            used while filling all the fields in job
                            application on company’s website. </p>

                        <p>We made storyboards to visualize how each of our solutions would fit the users scenarios and
                            how they would sove the users problems</p>

                        <p>Upon careful consideration, we decided to go ahead with a new application which would improve
                            the process of applying for job. The main reasons for why we went ahead with this option
                            were:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not all browsers would have supported auto-data filling. Platform specific plugins would
                                be difficult to implement.
                            </li>
                            <li>Generating and sharing QR codes would be a very efficient method of applying except
                                there was no way to recheck the details encoded in the QR code before submitting. Mixing
                                up QR codes with other applicants was a very plausible
                                scenario.
                            </li>
                            <li>Inputing the data while applying was the most cumbersome and time consuming part of the
                                process.&nbsp; </li>
                            <li>Most applicants would want to spend time reading the job description but not spend time
                                filling in details. A simple one-click apply step would be most convinient to them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <h3>Contextual Inqueries</h3>
                        <p>We realized, while the recruiter would still have to elaborately examine the applicants, this
                            process could be made easier for the applicant. Many of the applicants told us they gave up
                            on the application process after filling
                            out one or two of them. The process was too long and tedious to keep them motivated. We
                            observed that most applicants used multiple job portals such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster
                            etc to accomplish this task. We conducted
                            contextual Inquiry on the applicants, as we asked them to complete one application process
                            while we observed them; we came up with many pain points including: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Takes too long to complete the application- It took on average 30 mins for the applicant
                                to finish one application
                            </li>
                            <li>Repeated fields - Many fields of the application were repetitions of what was on the
                                resume of the applicant
                            </li>
                            <li>Auto complete did not always work - Auto Complete was a browser feature and did not
                                select radio buttons or checkboxes.
                            </li>
                            <li>No history or bookmarking feature - Applicants used external tools and notes to keep
                                track of the jobs they have applied to
                            </li>
                            <li>Irrelevant Results - Many times applicants would get results for full-time jobs when
                                they were searching for internships.
                            </li>
                            <li>The waiting period is too long- Applicants did not hear from the recruiter for 2-3
                                months at times.
                            </li>
                            <li>Too many job portals, too many profiles - Applicants used 2-3 job portals on average and
                                created a different profile on each of them.
                            </li>
                            <li>Refill same data that was filled in the job portal - Applicants had to fill in data in
                                the job portal once and sometimes again while filling the application.
                            </li>

                        <p>We also interviewed a recruiter of a company who filtered applications regularly, to
                            understand their side of the story, their expectations, and their issues. This helped us in
                            realizing the gap in the communication and the
                            application process. </p>

                        <p>After talking to applicants and observing their process of job application, we summarized our
                            findings and wrote each point on post-its to create an Affinity Diagram. This allowed us to
                            categorize the problems into groups and
                            rethink aproach we needed to take.</p>

                        <p>We came up with many features for our application that could possibly serve as a solution to
                            the problems. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using the swiping functions of Tinder app either to “Apply” (i.e. to Swipe right) or
                                “Reject” (i.e. to swipe left) an application was a great way to speed up the application
                                process. The applicant can view more details
                                by tapping on the result window.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Apps could pull data from LinkedIn or any other job portal so the applicant need not
                                create another profile on yet another job portal.
                            </li>
                            <li>The app would also pull search results from other job portals so that the applicant does
                                not miss out on any opportunity.
                            </li>
                            <li>Along with that, the applicant could “Skip” (i.e. Swipe up) to push the current result
                                at the back of the stack or results and come back to it later.
                            </li>
                            <li>We provide the applicant filtering options based on location and expected the salary.
                            </li>
                            <li>We provide the feature to bookmark and maintain the history of applications in order to
                                save the applicant’s time and avoid refilling applications they have previously applied
                                to.
                            </li>
                            <li>This application will also allow the applicant to upload their resume and portfolio for
                                easy reference of the recruiter
                            </li>
                            <li>The applicant will receive instant notification when the recruiter accepts their
                                application. Hence, the waiting period can be reduced.
                            </li>
                            <li>The other important feature we included was to allow the participants to communicate
                                with the recruiter one on one once their application had been accepted. This would allow
                                the applicant to get a clear idea about where
                                they stand and how to proceed.
                            </li>

                                <p>We tested our low fidelity paper prototype with users which got us many useful
                                    insights.</p>

                                    <li>We found out that user wants to know what information is getting pulled from
                                        LinkedIn when they sign up from an existing profile on LinkedIn.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>When user profile is imported from the LinkedIn they are more inclined to see
                                        the job listings soon after they import the details rather than again going to
                                        fill the details on this website.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>About the portfolio section they wanted web portfolio and options to upload
                                        resume on the website so that they can send it as soon as possible.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Filter options were not clear to them, so we asked for filter option for search
                                        which they usually enter for job search.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>When job search is listed they were not sure of what those elements do on the
                                        screens.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Remove the profile section soon after the signup from the flow.</li>
                                    <li>Improve filter options and restrict them to basic and most important ones which
                                        are job title, location and salary preference if any.

                                <p>We tested our high fidelity prototype with users. We came up with a few major
                                    issues:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Participant was not able to figure out at first look what this application is
                                        all about and its purpose.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Soon after login user wanted to set search preference and start the job search.
                                        User was not that much concerned about the details pulled out from LinkedIn and
                                        want to glance the jobs as per search results.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>It was difficult for user to find the jobs which they bookmarked</li>
                                    <li>History feature was not showing the dates when they applied for the job</li>
                                    <li>For messaged the notification was not clear to the user</li>
                                    <li>User wanted a function to intimate recruiter about inclination towards a
                                        particular job. User suggested including super like type feature in this
                                        application.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>User had had no idea what is the difference among the 3 gesture. Means changing
                                        company, ← and → mean changing place, etc.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>On job description page, at the very last of the description options to apply
                                        and reject was required.i. User felt top navigation height to be increased as it
                                        looked congested.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We corrected these issues by a few changes in the prototype:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Made job description page with options to apply for that particular job which
                                        was not available before.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Made history and bookmarks feature to work as expected. We made a list of all
                                        the jobs to which user has applied with dates, a list of jobs user refused and
                                        approved applications.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Option for resume upload was missing which we changed.</li>
                                    <li>We made notification on messages to show when recruiter accepts your profile and
                                        if recruiter directly approaches you for a job.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We changed the icons for applying and reject to jobs to make them more
                                        appropriate.
                                    </li>

                                <p>Our final user testing yielded a few changes as well such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>We made swiping gesture more informative for the first time user so that they
                                        must be aware of how this application works.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We added a new feature of skipping a application. When user swipe up then that
                                        application goes back to the queue and gives user a flexibility to apply to that
                                        application later and glance through other job openings.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We made a bookmark page which has a list of all the bookmarked application which
                                        interested the applicant but they want to look into them later.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
